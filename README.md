# Sample <NodeJS/React>

TerraGrow is an intelligent web app that uses a Random Forest model for crop recommendations and the Llama3-8b-8192 model from Groq to suggest yield improvement strategies. By analyzing factors like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, and pH, it provides data-driven insights to help farmers optimize planting decisions and achieve higher yields.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started  

### Open Using Daytona  

1. **Install Daytona**: Follow the [Daytona installation guide](https://www.daytona.io/docs/installation/installation/).  
2. **Create the Workspace**:  
   ```bash

   ```  

3. **Add 3000 as forwarded ports.**
3. **Set up the environment variables by creating a ```.env``` file in the backend directory and add given details:**: 
   ```bash  
   PORT=3000
   GROQ_API_KEY=<YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY>
   ```  

4. **Start the Application**:  
   Navigate to backend folder
